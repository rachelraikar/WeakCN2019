# Work on weak CN stars in Andromeda M31
  
## Requirements/ Setup
  ### Installing Anaconda
    Download Anaconda from the website below. Make sure to install Python 3.7 version! 
[Anaconda link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) 
    
  ### Using Jupyter
    Open up Anaconda Navigator and type 'jupyter notebook' into it. This launches jupyter on your web browser.
    Alternatively use terminal to cd to directory and open jupyter from there by typing 'jupyter notebook'

  ### How to set up a Git repository on your laptop
    
    1. Go to terminal and cd to the spot you would like the WeakCN2019 repository (folder)
    2. Then type: git clone https://github.com/rachelraikar/WeakCN2019.git into your terminal. 
        This will copy the repository as a folder onto your laptop with the files\n",
    
  ### How to pull/push changes
   #### Pull Changes 
        To pull any changes made by others, use terminal to navigate to directory and type git pull.
   
   #### Push Changes
       
       After making any changes on the notebook, save and checkpoint. These changes will be saved locally. 
       Then, to push this to Github, navigate to the directory on terminal and type: 
                 git add 'the file name
                 git commit -m 'your message/comments'  (-a -m instead of -m if not mac user)
                 git push
    
        The change should now be visible on github."
